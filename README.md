To see Inventory system, need to connect mySQL databse. In connection.php, there are my own database user, password, and databse. So need to modify yours. sql.php shows quaries to create table and insert values. images folder contains pics for data. The first page of inventory system is inventory.php.

I hope you will be able to see pages in proper way.

Now, my samples are available to see in my website.
